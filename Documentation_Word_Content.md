Corner Grocer Item Tracking Program â€“ Documentation

The Corner Grocer Item Tracking Program demonstrates professional C++ development through a class-based design that efficiently processes grocery purchase data. At the core of the implementation is the GroceryTracker class, which follows object-oriented principles by encapsulating data in private members and exposing public methods for user interaction. A std::map<string, int> stores frequency counts for each item, allowing for efficient lookups, automatic sorting, and deduplication. The class constructor initializes the program by loading purchase data from an input file and generating a backup file named frequency.dat to preserve all results.

The program reads data line by line, updating item counts as it processes the input file. By using the map container, lookups maintain O(log n) performance, ensuring both memory efficiency and quick response times even for large datasets. A menu-driven user interface provides a simple and intuitive way to interact with the system. Users may search for a specific item to see its frequency, view a complete table of all items with their counts, or generate a histogram visualization where each asterisk represents one purchase. A fourth menu option allows users to exit the program gracefully. [INSERT SCREENSHOT: Menu and sample options]

Robust error handling is built into the design to ensure stability and reliability. The program validates file operations, manages input errors, and prevents crashes from invalid menu selections or non-existent item searches. Additionally, the system automatically creates the backup frequency.dat file at startup, preserving data for analysis without requiring user intervention. File paths are handled in a cross-platform manner, supporting both Windows and Unix systems. [INSERT SCREENSHOT: Frequency list] [INSERT SCREENSHOT: Histogram]

The implementation adheres to industry best practices by following C++17 standards, applying clear naming conventions, using modular functions with single responsibilities, and providing inline comments for maintainability. Proper memory management and structured error control further highlight the professional quality of the code. Altogether, the Corner Grocer Item Tracking Program successfully meets its functional requirements while demonstrating mastery of object-oriented design, file I/O, and modern C++ development practices.
